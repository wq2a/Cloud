Hierarchical Routing

Network Topology:[Host A]->(Router)->(Router)->[Host B]

Data Flow:
[Application]<-process-to-process->[Application]
[Transport]<-host-to-host->[Transport]
[Internet]
[Link]

Encapsulation:
[Message]		[Application]
segment/datagram[Ht][M]	[Transport]
packet[Hn][Ht][M]	[Network]
frame[Hi][Hn][Ht][M]	[Link]
			[Physical]

[Data]					[Application]
[UDPheader][UDPdata]			[Transport]
[IPheader][IPdata]			[Network]
[Frameheader][Framedata][Framefooter]	[Link]

Why layering:
Reduce design complexity
The design can evolve more easily

each layer provides a service to the layer above
each layer communicates with its peer layer in another node through a protocol

TCP/IP model
[Application]supporting networking application
FTP,SMTP,HTTP
[Transport]host-to-host data transfer
TCP,UDP
[Network]routing and forwarding of datagrams from source to destination
IP
-packet format
-addressing conventions
-packet handling conventions

routing table
|
routing protocols
-path selection
-RIP,OSPF,BGP
ICMP protocol
-error reporting
-router signaling
[Link]data transfer between neighboring network elements
PPP,Ethernet
[Physical]bits on the wire

OSI reference model
[Application]	APDU
[Presentation]	PPDU
[Session]	SPDU
[Transport]	TPDU
[Network]	Packet
[Data link]	Frame
[Physical]	Bit

IPv4 Format

IP address:32-bit identifier for host,router interface
Interface:connection between host,router and physical link

Special Purpose Addresses
0.0.0.0/8:broadcast messages to the current network
255.255.255.255/32:any host on the local subnet
127.0.0.0/8:loopback addresses to the local host
10.0.0.0/8 or 192.168.0.0/16:local communications within aprivate network
